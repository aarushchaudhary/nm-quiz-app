# ==============================================================================

# --- Prevent Directory Listing ---
# This stops visitors from seeing a list of files in a directory if there's no index.php.
Options -Indexes

# --- LAN Access Control ---
# This is the core security rule. It denies all access by default and then
# specifically allows access only from the IP addresses you define.

# 1. Deny all requests by default
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all

# 2. Allow requests from localhost (for your own development machine)
Allow from 127.0.0.1
Allow from ::1

# 3. **IMPORTANT**: Allow requests from your college's LAN IP range.
# You MUST replace the example IP ranges below with the actual IP ranges
# used by your college's network.
#
# Example for a network range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254:
Allow from 10.180.0.1 to 10.180.0.254

# Example for a network range of 10.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.254:
# Allow from 10.0
# Allow from 10.1

# You can add multiple "Allow from" lines if your college has multiple network segments.
# Ask your college's IT department for the correct IP address ranges.
# For example:
# Allow from 172.16
# Allow from 10.5
